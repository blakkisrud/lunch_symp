Talk points to be given by me at a lunch symposia 24. of may 2017 at University of
Oslo. Audience are mainly physisists

Johan Blakkisrud, Oslo 18.05.2017

Some caveats/guidelines
==========================================================

* Description of other work is not exhaustive
* I will focus mostly on oncology but the use of targeted
  radiotherapy is not limited to this clinical use
* I am a mere physisist and might not be able to answer 
  tricky questions regarding biology, chemistry or medicine,
  but that does not mean that you are not free to ask
* Ask questions during this talk - especially if something
  is unclear or in your opinion wrong, the more humiliating 
  the better

Historic setting - building up to the 21. century medicine
==========================================================

Start with a disease - goiter (struma) - Why was goiter more prevalent 
in the eastern than the western part of Norway? (ilus. by the woman from 
Hedmark) Nothing new, Pliny the Elder (23-79 c.e.) described seaweed to treat 
goiter. 

Luncheon in MIT in 1937 - Saul Hertz asks Karl Compton (not the guy with the
Compton scatter, that was his younger brother Arthur Compton) if it is 
possible to make radioactive iodine. Well, yes, Enrico Fermi did so and 
published it in 1934 - 128-I, it would behave just like regular I, but be
possible to trace.

First traced with Geiger-Muller-counters through the 40s - used to treat 
various diseases of the thyroid and invetigate the thyroid metabolism. 
Seminal paper in oncology was published by Samuel Seidlin, treating 
Bernard Brunstein (Life magazine article oct. 31 1949) - Front Cover Princess 
Margharet, two covers back is Julius Robert Oppenheimer

The anger camera made it possible to not only meassure but also "see" the
radiation, great article in Nature (1952) with an image - a note in the 
article says that the tumor had 20 mCu (740 MBq) this had been "determined 
independently" - quite short imaging time - approx 1 hr, if used the most
sensitive film technique, approx 20 hr would be needed

Grand idea - Use radiation as therapy and simultaneously "see" the therapy
==========================================================================

The general idea in targeted radiotherapy is to deliever the radiation to
the cancerous site, thus giving a lethal dose of radiation. A really nice
sum-up is that in external beam radiation therapy, the position is the
revealing attribute of the target, when in targeted radionuclide therapy
the biology, or on the more fundamental level chemistry is the revealing
attribute. 

--Examples of isotopes, examples of carrier molecules--

The point with the portemaunto Theronosis is that the remedy is both diagnostic,
it is possible to observe, and therapeutic, acts as a treatment. Internal dosimetry
is a way of evaluating such schemes

General methodology
==========================================================================

Two distinct steps

1. Get the number of disintegrations happening inside the relevant organs.
2. Convert the disintegrations into deposited energy.

1. 



Why do you want to do internal dosimetry?
==========================================================================

* For safety reasons, you know how much radiation/drug gets delievered 
  without waiting/pushing for the clinical effect

* For efficiency reasons, you want to know how much radiation get 
  delievered to the tumours

* Tailoring to safety and efficacy, estimate how much to give to limit
  toxicity

* Descriminate in drug trials if different therapy regimes are being used
  e.g. see if a particular pre-treatment or dosage shift the route of the
  drug
